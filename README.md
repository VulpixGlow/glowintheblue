**GLOW IN THE BLUE**

**A cozy place for pacing your day.**

Glow in the Blue is the brainchild of Chumi Gonzalez, Elisa Bennett, Hannah Kemp, and Shannon Chang. We wanted to create a space for people to hold themselves accountable in a thoughtful and supportive way. 

Whether making sure they spent time meditating or that they allocated time to exercise, Glow in the Blue is there as a time-allocation buddy for all users. Glow in the Blue allows a variety of activities to be logged and for total times to be accumulated in user analytics. Furthermore, users can create groups to add accountability while competing with friends in a chosen activity. At the end of the allotted group session time, statistics will be revealed.
